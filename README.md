# Neighborhood housing rental markets and social-spatial features in Metro New York City Area

## Background

The goal for this project is to provide investors and local communities with separate optimized improvement schemes for the rental market integrating their local social and physical conditions and budgets.

In general, people tend to adopt dwelling features (for example, interior features like the numbers of bedrooms and bathrooms, furnishing conditions, views, and exterior features like building/community amenities and HOA services) to predict rental prices. However, **socio-spatial features, including location, demographics, social environments, local transportation, and characteristics of neighborhood-built environments, could be determinant factors of rental prices besides rental properties themselves.** These factors may also associate with the values of developed or under-development lands. Particularly in dense areas/cities like Manhattan, commute services and city life features affect peopleâ€™s housing choices with a low car use compared to suburban areas.

Because of the lack of environmental data relating to rental market data, **most projects of rental price prediction had overlooked the environmental factors** that only tested the housing interior features and using few of neighborhood features.

Therefore, the project has tested the importance of using the outside socio-spatial features under seven major categories (demographics, social engagement, natural environment, health service, neighborhood environments, living opportunities, and transportation conditions) to predict average rental prices for neighborhoods in six US metropolitan areas.

## Objectives

**1. Predict median neighborhood rental prices based on the neighborhood socio-spatial features**

For the average neighborhood housing price, the individual apartment features would be less important compared with its location and outside environments. The prediction results could provide an insight to estimate the general rental market value through socio-spatial data without local investigations. Landlords and investors can use such information for decision making on investing or renovating rental properties in a certain neighborhood. Meanwhile, the prediction models can assist residents in housing choices. Moreover, as the project has tested neighborhoods in six cities, we may apply the method to other areas/cities based on different business demands.

**2. Identify the key environmental features for increasing the neighborhood market values**

The project has examined over 40 types of socio-spatial features. It would help us to idenfity which of them affect the average neighborhood rents most (with the high preditive powers and can be manipulated in practice) and in which directions. The results also provided the insights for local government and communities for neighborhood improvements.
